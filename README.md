A quick and dirty extension to make assignments in Kaplan dark mode.
The super disgusting implementation is due to the spaghettiness of Kaplan web code

Increase the number until the dark mode starts applying.

not use the modules I use
- do not directly charge customers for using an application that uses this code base *
- have this same clause for the distribution and integration of your code

*: The code may still be used in a commercial operation as long as it is offered free.
   For example, you may make use of this code in an operation that makes a profit off of
   advertisements, as long as you do not charge users to pay for this code's functionality
   - including the functionality of this code "free" to certain tiers of purchase but not
   others is considered charging the user directly.
